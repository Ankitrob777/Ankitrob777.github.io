    <center>
      <p>I am going to tell you story of a stubborn, Business
        magnate, industrial designer, Engineer and philanthropist. (the real world Tony stark) Elon Musk and his Space
        agency SpaceX.<br>
        I will also talk about the Journey of their setellites launchs. Send me your Feedback to robankit777@gmail.com.
        Lets start. </p>

      <h1>SpaceX</h1>
      <p>Space Exploration Technologies Corp.,
        t/a SpaceX, is an American aerospace manufacturer and space transportation services company
        headquartered in Hawthorne, California. It was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk with the goal
        of reducing space transportation costs to enable the colonization of Mars.
        SpaceX has developed several launch vehicles, the Starlink satellite constellation,
        the Dragon cargo spacecraft, and flown humans to the International Space Station on
        the Crew Dragon Demo-2. A major goal of SpaceX has been to develop a rapidly reusable
        launch system. As of March 2013, the publicly announced aspects of this technology
        development effort include an active test campaign of the low-altitude, low-velocity
        Grasshopper flight test vehicle and a high-altitude, high-speed Falcon 9
        post-mission booster return test campaign. In 2015, SpaceX successfully landed the first
        orbital rocket stage on 21 December 2015. I picked it up from wikipedia, just in case
        if you don't Know
        about SpaceX. Now lets see the whole Journey. </p>

      <h1 style="margin-top: 7rem;">Failure</h1>
      <p>The First three launches of SpaceX was complete failure .It was a difficult time for SpaceX
        .
        The first satellite was launched on 24 March 2006 with a payload mass of 19.50kg and
        the customer country was United states. It was a government Research satellite and the
        reason of failure was Engine fire during launch. The second failure was 21 March 2007 and
        the reason was Engine shutdown, third with payloadmass of 8kg due to collision during launch

        . </p>

      <p>The dream of Elon musk to develop a rapidly reusable
        launch system and Mars colonization
        was getting faded after failure
        of back to back 3 mission started from march 2006 to august 2008. The bond
        of trust of United state with SpaceX was getting powerless as all 3 mission's
        customer country was United state. Here i'm presenting the story of SpaceX after
        August 2008.

      <ul>
        <li> The first privately funded liquid-fueled rocket to reach orbit (Falcon 1 flight 4 on 28 September 2008).
        </li>
        <li>The first privately developed liquid-fueled rocket to put a commercial satellite in orbit (RazakSAT on
          Falcon 1 flight 5 on 14 July 2009).</li>
        <li>The first private company to successfully launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft (SpaceX Dragon on COTS
          Demo Flight 1 on 9 December 2010).</li>
        <li>The first private company to send a spacecraft to the International Space Station (Dragon C2+ on 25 May
          2012).</li>
        <li>The first private company to send a satellite into geosynchronous orbit (SES-8 on Falcon 9 flight 7 on 3
          December 2013).</li>
        <li>The first landing of an orbital rocket's first stage on land (Falcon 9 flight 20 on 22 December 2015).</li>
        <li>The first landing of an orbital rocket's first stage on an ocean platform (Falcon 9 flight 23 on 8 April
          2016).</li>
        <li> The first relaunch and landing of a used orbital rocket stage (B1021 on Falcon 9 flight 32 on 30 March
          2017).</li>
        <li>The first controlled flyback and recovery of a payload fairing (Falcon 9 flight 32 on 30 March 2017).</li>
        <li>The first re-flight of a commercial cargo spacecraft. (Dragon C106 on SpaceX CRS-11 mission on 3 June 2017).
        </li>
        <li>The first private company to send an object into heliocentric orbit (Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster on Falcon
          Heavy test flight on 6 February 2018).</li>
      </ul>
